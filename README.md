PyPoll contains a dataset which is analysed using python scripting to find the winner of an election given a list of voter ID's, their county and the name of the candidate they placed a vote against.

PyBank contains a dataset which holds the profit/loss data for months in a bank. During this project, we were asked to use Python to create a script which calculated the total prpofit/loss for the time period, the change in profit/loss month to month, the total number of months in the data, the greatest change in profit/loss between two months and when it occurred and finally the average change in profit/loss.
